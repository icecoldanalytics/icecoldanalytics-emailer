"""
Single source of truth for the Rest Edge signal: away team on a
back-to-back, home team rested exactly two days -> back the home side.

Signal 1 (home rested 3+ days) backtested at -3.6% ROI / 57.6% win rate
across 311 games at real closing moneylines, pooled across all four
backfilled seasons (see backtest_rest_signals.py / data/rest_signal_backtest.json)
and has been retired - it is no longer computed or logged anywhere in the
live pipeline.

Ported verbatim from the grindline repo's .github/scripts/rest_edge.py,
which is the canonical definition - this copy must not drift from it.

Every script that needs the rule itself, or the odds-to-profit math, should
import from here rather than re-deriving it. Each caller keeps its own
schedule-fetching (that legitimately differs by data source), and only
passes plain "days since last game" integers in here.
